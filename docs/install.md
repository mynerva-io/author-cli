Follow the instructions below for your operating system to install the
`mynerva-author` command line tool. Be sure to follow the
[Verify your installation](#verify-your-installation) steps after following the
OS-specific instructions.

### macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1.  [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if not already installed).

    ```shell
    brew install mynerva-io/tap/mynerva-author
    ```

### Windows

    # Allow PowerShell to execute arbitrary code (you may be prompted to allow this)
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser

    # Download and execute the Scoop installer
    Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')
    ```

2.  Install the command line tool.

    ```powershell
    # Install git (this is required to add the Mynerva bucket)
    scoop install git

    # Tell scoop where to find Mynerva's published packages
    scoop bucket add mynerva https://github.com/mynerva-io/scoop-bucket.git

    # Install the mynerva-author tool
    scoop install mynerva/mynerva-author
    ```

### Custom installation

If you're using Linux, or you want more control over your installation, you can
follow these steps.

1.  Download the binary from the
    [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/mynerva-io/author-cli/releases).
2.  Add the executable to your `PATH`. Make sure to set the executable bit if
    necessary.

Alternatively, you can download and build the Go source code.

## Verify your installation

1.  Log in to Mynerva using the command line tool.
    ```shell
    # Authenticate with the Mynerva API
    # This should prompt you for your email and password
    mynerva-author auth login
    ```
2.  Verify that the authentication worked.
    ```shell
    mynerva-author auth status
    ```
    The output should look something like this:
    ```
    âœ… Authenticated (until Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:38:46 UTC)
    ```
